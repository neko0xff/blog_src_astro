## 00 緒論
當要測試自架或其它的DNS是否有效時，則需要另行在系統上自行設置相關的設定

<!--more-->

## 01 加入用於解析的DNS Server 

- resolv.conf : 用於管理多個DNS設定檔的框架
  * 設定檔: `/etc/resolv.conf`
    ```
      nameserver 8.8.8.8
      nameserver 8.8.4.4
      nameserver 1.1.1.1
      nameserver 1.0.0.1
    ```

## 02 測試正反解是否正常

### 2-0 安裝相關工具
- arch: `$ sudo pacman -S dnsutils`

### 2-1 正解

```bash
$ nslookup www.google.com
Server:         192.168.0.1
Address:        192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   www.google.com
Address: 142.251.43.4
Name:   www.google.com
Address: 2404:6800:4012:3::2004
```

### 2-2 反解

```bash
$ nslookup 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa    name = dns.google.

## 03 查詢DNS主機資訊
WHOIS是用來查詢網際網路中域名的IP以及所有者等資訊的傳輸協定

### 3-0 安裝相關工具
- Arch/Manjaro: `$ sudo pacman -S whois`

### 3-1 檢視

```
